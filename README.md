# Clean Browser

Most modern browsers are up to no good, mostly for privacy reasons, but some also fail to satisfy in user experience. This document provides a rough guidance on how to install Firefox so that it is up to par with other browsers.

## Download Firefox ESR

Download [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/enterprise/). The ESR version is much cleaner and provides more privacy than the normal version of Firefox. Reasons to discard other browsers:

- Firefox: Bloated with features no one really uses
- Chrome: Closed source by Google
- Opera GX: Closed source by China
- Edge: Add-Ons
- Chromium: No Sync capabilities

## Install Add-Ons



## about:config settings

Type `about:config` in URL bar and set following parameters.

Remove fullscreen transitions. These are slow and buggy.
